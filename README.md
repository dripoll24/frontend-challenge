## Code Challenge

> List of F1 world champions.

Use http://ergast.com/mrd/ to create a single page application that
presents a list that shows the F1 world champions starting from 2005 until
2015. Clicking on an item shows the list of the winners for every race for the
selected year. We also request to highlight the row when the winner has
been the world champion in the same season.
